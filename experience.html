                <h3>Infosys System Engineer Intern</h3>
                <p><strong>January 2025 â€“ June 2025</strong></p>
                
                    <p>During my internship at Infosys as a System Engineer Intern, I had the opportunity to work on building and maintaining scalable web applications using .NET and Angular. I was involved in both frontend and backend development, where I integrated RESTful APIs to ensure smooth communication between systems.

I also focused on optimizing database queries to enhance application performance and efficiency. Working in an Agile environment, I actively participated in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and code reviews, which helped me understand team dynamics and agile practices better.

This experience gave me solid hands-on exposure to full-stack development and allowed me to contribute to real-world projects, enhancing both my technical and collaborative skills.</p>
